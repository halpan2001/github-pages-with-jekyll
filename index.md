# Welcome to Hal's Profile

Nice to meet you! 

I'm an aspiring developer, designer and animator at the University of Southern California who wants to their skills to make the world a better place. I'm a Junior (class of 2020) in the Iovine and Young Academy's 3rd Cohort majoring in Arts, Technology, and the Business of Innovation with an emphasis in Design and Development and a minor in Animation and Digital Arts (what a mouthful). 

I have a passion for people that I practice in working on projects that push forward social change. Currently, I'm working on a consulting project with LAX to make the airport more accessible for folks with disabilities and applying Universal Design principles so that everyone benefits! Also currently musing and imagining what the ideal system for education is...
